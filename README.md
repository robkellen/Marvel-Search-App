# Marvel-Search-App

As fans of everything Marvel we created an app that allows you to search for your favorite character to find references to each comic and movie they appear in.  In the comics section the search will return paginated content including comic cover, date published, and a brief summary from the Marvel API.  In the movies section the search will return paginated content including movie poster, release date, a brief summary, and rating from the OMDB API.
