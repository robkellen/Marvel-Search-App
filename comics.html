          <p> In the late 1880's a child by the name of James
             Howlett was born. As a child James was a frail and
              sick boy. His allergies didn't allow him to go 
              out and play much. His father had requested that 
              a twelve year old girl be brought to their estate.
               That girl was named Rose and she was to be a friend
                and play mate to James. She read to him and looked
                 after him. Along with the grounds keeper's son,
                  Dog, James and Rose were the only children on the
                   hill where the estate was. They had become close 
                   friends and played together as much as possible
                    but Dog slowly grew away from them. Dog's father,
                     the grounds keeper was named Thomas Logan, he 
                     was an alcoholic and abuse his son.</p>
